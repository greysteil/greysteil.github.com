For the last 12 months I've been teaching myself to code. It's been hard.

- Practice. There's no substitute for trying things out

- Quality time. You need big chunks to get into it

- Ask for help. It can be much more efficient to do things that way

- Work with others. It'll give you a project that's about more than just you
