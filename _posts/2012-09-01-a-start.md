Starting something new is hard. It's especially hard if, like me, you're obsessive. This is my start at blogging.

I've always found starting new things hard. I find it hard to overcome the frustration of being a beginner, when I'm used to being an expert. It's also sometimes hard to justify the inefficiency of working at things I'm new to. Both are short term issues, but the short term matters.

If you're obsessive, like me, I think starting is particularly hard. Everything I do has to be good, and I have to finish everything I start. Poor quality work haunts me. I obsess. For me, the potential downside of starting something new is bigger. If I'm not certain I can do it, and do it well, I almost certainly won't start it.

Sometimes, the above is good. It drives me to produce great quality work. Sometimes it's crippling. The trouble is, making mistakes is one of the best ways to learn. I learn more slowly because I worry too much about mistakes.

Twelve months ago I decided I should write a blog. Twelve months later, this is my start. I'll make some mistakes, but hopefully I'll learn a lot.
