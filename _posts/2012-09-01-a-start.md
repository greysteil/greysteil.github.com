Starting something new is hard. It's especially hard if, like me, you're obsessive. This is my start at blogging.

I've always found starting new things hard. Like everyone, I find it hard to overcome the personal frustration of being a beginner, when I'm used to being an expert. Further, I find it hard to justify how inefficient I am while learning something new. Both are short term frustrations, but the short term matters.

For me, I think there's another factor that makes starting hard: everything I do has to be good, and I have to finish everything I start. Poor quality work haunts me. I obsess. For me, the potential downside of starting something new is bigger. If I'm not certain I can do it, and do it well, I almost certainly won't start it.

Sometimes, that obsessiveness is good. It drives me to produce great quality work. Sometimes, however, it's crippling, because making mistakes is one of the best ways to learn. I learn more slowly because I worry too much about making mistakes.

Twelve months ago I decided I should write a blog. Twelve months later, this is my start. I'll make some mistakes, but hopefully I'll learn a lot.
