Starting something new is hard. It's especially hard if, like me, you're obsessive.

I've always found starting new things hard. Being bad at things frustrates me, and I find it hard to justify how inefficient I am while learning something new. They're short term frustrations, but the short term matters.

I also struggle with a need to be proud of everything I do. Poor quality work haunts me, and the fear of it adds to the downside of starting something new. If I'm not certain I can do it, and do it well, I almost certainly won't start it.

Sometimes that obsessiveness is good: it drives me to produce great work. Sometimes it's bad: I learn slower because I worry too much about making mistakes.

Twelve months ago I decided I should write a blog. Twelve months later, this is my start. I'll make some mistakes, but hopefully I'll learn a lot.
