Starting something new is hard. It's especially hard if, like me, you're obsessive. This is my start at blogging.

Starting new things is hard. We start as beginners, when we're used to being experts. As an experience, it's hard to overcome the frustration. Within a team, it can be hard to justify the inefficiency. Both are short term, but the short term matters.

If you're obsessive, like me, starting is particularly hard. Everything I do has to be good, and I have to finish everything I start. Poor quality work haunts me. I obsess. For me, the potential downside of starting something new is bigger. If I'm not certain I can do it, and do it well, I almost certainly won't start it.

Sometimes, the above is good. It drives me to produce great quality work. Sometimes it's crippling. The trouble is, making mistakes is one of the best ways to learn. If you can't let yourself make any then you'll learn more slowly.

Twelve months ago I decided I should write a blog. Twelve months later, this is my start. I'll make some mistakes, but hopefully I'll learn a lot.
