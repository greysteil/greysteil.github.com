Recently, I've been thinking about how to make good decision. We've made a
couple of mistakes on the team I'm on at the moment, and I've been trying to
understand what's behind those mistakes, and what's behind the decisions we
make right.

- Small decisions. Trying to make big ones is difficult. We've been most
successful where we've broken them down into smaller ones.

- Extra pairs of eyes. If not when you're making the decision, then soon
after. Dashboards example.
