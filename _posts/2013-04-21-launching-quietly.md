================

If you possibly can, don't coincide your product release with your press
release. There's no upside, only downsides:

- You won't be ready if you get published early (it happens)
- You won't have a chance to act on feedback from new users
- Migrating existing users will distract you

The Next Web published on [GoCardless](https://gocardless.com) 3 days earlier
than we'd planned. Thankfully the new product had been live for days.
