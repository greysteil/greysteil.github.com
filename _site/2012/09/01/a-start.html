<h1>A start</h1>

<p class="meta">01 Sept 2012 - London</p>


<p>Starting something new is hard. It's especially hard if, like me, you're obsessive. This is my start at blogging.</p>

<p>Starting new things is hard. We start as beginners, when we're used to being experts. As an experience, it's hard to overcome the frustration. Within a team, it can be hard to justify the inefficiency. Both are short term, but the short term matters.</p>

<p>If you're obsessive, like me, starting is particularly hard. Everything I do has to be good, and I have to finish everything I start. Poor quality work haunts me. I obsess. For me, the potential downside of starting something new is bigger. If I'm not certain I can do it, and do it well, I almost certainly won't start it.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the above is good. It drives me to produce great quality work. Sometimes, however, it's crippling. Twelve months ago I decided I should write a blog. I didn't start that day because I had other things to do. The next day was the same. And the week after. I couldn't bring myself to, because I knew I'd be bad, and I wasn't sure I could finish it.</p>

<p>Twelve months later, this is my start. I'll get better, and I'll try.</p>
